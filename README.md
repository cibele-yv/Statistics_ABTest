# Statistics_ABTest
AB Test analysis applied in a landing page using Statistics model

For this project, I've been working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this notebook we are going to use statiscts model in python, such as probability, hipotheses test and logistic regression
